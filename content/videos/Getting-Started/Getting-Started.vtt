<v Joshua>Hi, this is Joshua Wright.</v>

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.050
In this video we'll look through some of the directions

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.160
to access and make the most of the Lab Wiki system.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.060
In this course you've received a printed workbook

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.790
that has all of the lab directions

6
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.280
for everything that we're going to do in the course.

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.880
You also have access to these same directions

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.580
in the form of what we call the Lab Wiki,

9
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.870
which is the default home page on both the Linux

10
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.480
and the Windows virtual machine web browsers.

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.190
I'm going to first start with the Linux virtual machine,

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.000
I already have that started here.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.513
I'm going to full screen my browser window.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.360
And then I'm going to open

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.053
the Firefox browser on the desktop.

16
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.290
You'll see that when you open the browser

17
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.440
it defaults to the home page which is the Lab Wiki,

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.670
with all of the directions,

19
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.260
and the same content that's used

20
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.280
to make the printed workbook.

21
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.720
There are some extra features here

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.241
such as easy navigation to the different lab exercises.

23
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.720
The hamburger menu here can hide or open

24
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.623
that navigation menu as needed.

25
00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:07.174
There's also a search feature

26
00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:09.250
where you can type in any string,

27
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.380
and it will show you matching lab exercises

28
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.823
that include that keyword.

29
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.010
And then we have this home page,

30
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.730
which shows you the beginning directions, conventions,

31
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.560
and the latest version with a datestamp down here

32
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.690
for the version of the lab instructions

33
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.660
that you're looking at.

34
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.760
And one of the benefits of having this electronic

35
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.850
is that you can move the browser window

36
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.000
to the side of your screen

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.480
so you can look at it while you work on

38
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.910
the lab exercise steps.

39
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.320
You can also update the lab exercise steps

40
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.450
by running the update-wiki command shown here.

41
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.450
When prompted enter the sec504 user password, sec504.

42
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.410
The virtual machine will go out,

43
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.400
download the latest lab files

44
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.970
with any typos, or new lab directions that we've added,

45
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.770
and then complete and obtain the latest lab directions.

46
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.040
Now after your instructor's advice,

47
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.070
he or she may also tell you to run update-labs.

48
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.310
That will make changes to the virtual machine

49
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.900
but you don't need to do that

50
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.023
unless advised by your instructor.

51
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.960
Similar commands are available

52
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.230
on the Windows virtual machine as well.

53
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.730
Again here if I open the default web browser

54
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.133
which is Google Chrome,

55
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.780
the home page will show you all of the lab directions

56
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.510
with the same content and the same features.

57
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.043
Down here we see the version for the lab exercises.

58
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.780
I'm going to just move this off

59
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.580
to the right-hand side of my screen,

60
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.800
and from Windows we can download the latest content as well.

61
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.750
Here we see the command is slightly different,

62
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.790
it's update-wiki.ps1.

63
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.780
So I'm going to open a PowerShell prompt

64
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.800
as an administrator, right-clicking on the PowerShell icon,

65
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.850
and then choosing Run as administrator,

66
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.520
and from the PowerShell prompt

67
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.733
I'm going to run update-wiki.ps1.

68
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.870
Like the Linux VM, the Windows VM will go online

69
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.110
and download the latest lab content.

70
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.180
You may be prompted if you want your machine

71
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.070
to be discoverable.

72
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.322
I'm gonna say no there.

73
00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:18.593
And after a couple of seconds

74
00:03:18.593 --> 00:03:21.090
you'll have the latest lab content delivered

75
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.593
to the Windows virtual machine as well.

76
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.802
Again your instructor may advise you

77
00:03:33.802 --> 00:03:38.802
to run the update-labs.ps1 script as well,

78
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.770
which will download and make any changes necessary

79
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.200
for their virtual machine to improve lab exercises

80
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.210
or to troubleshoot or fix any bugs that we experience.

81
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.760
You don't need to run this command

82
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.023
unless you're advised to by your instructor.

83
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.970
That's it with those simple commands

84
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.210
you'll have the latest lab exercise content

85
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.070
as you work through the lab exercises.

86
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.290
If I refresh my browser

87
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.840
you'll see that the version has changed,

88
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.120
indicating that we have the latest version

89
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.820
of the lab exercise steps.

90
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.242
You can update the wiki as often as desired.

91
00:04:12.242 --> 00:04:15.360
Generally following the advice of your instructor

92
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.514
or if you've worked on lab exercises

93
00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:21.040
and you may have encountered a bug, or a typo,

94
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.330
or possibly, are looking for clarification.

95
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.680
You can run update-wiki

96
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.140
to obtain the very latest information

97
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.600
as we continue to refine and improve the lab directions.

98
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.453
That's it for this video set, nice work!
